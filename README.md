# JenkinsPipeline-MasterSlave-Nodes
A Jenkins master comes with the basic installation of Jenkins, and in this configuration, the master handles all the tasks for your build system.
If you are working on multiple projects you may run multiple jobs on each and every project. 
Some projects need to run on some particular nodes, and in this process, we need to configure slaves.
